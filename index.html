        <p>Hello! Welcome to my recipe blog. I was born and raised in England in a large family of both
          vegetarians and meat eaters. I am Indian and LOVE Indian food. I also LOVE British food like Heinz beans, fish and chips, and
          the famous British breakfast. I moved to California as a young woman and deeply missed ingredients that were
          readily available in England. The food in America is decent, but it never hit the spot. So my family and I
          began to experiment with food. The results were delicious, so delicious that people began to ask us for the
          recipes. So here I am - representing my family cooking traditions. Please feel free to contact me with
          suggestions! I look forward to hearing from you.
